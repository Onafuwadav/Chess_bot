Chess Bot Project
This project encompasses the creation of a Chess Bot, integrating a self-designed chess engine with computer vision capabilities to enable the bot to play against human opponents on a physical board. The bot utilizes algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning for decision-making, move ordering and piece square tables to enhance its move selection.

Features
Chess Engine: Developed a custom chess engine implementing Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms for optimal move selection.
Move Decision Making: Utilizes piece square tables for strategic move decision-making.
Computer Vision Integration: Employs a camera for visual input, allowing the bot to perceive the physical chessboard.
Voice Output: Utilizes a speaker to announce the moves the bot intends to make audibly.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Implemented in C++.
Libraries and Frameworks: 
Computer Vision Tools: 
Hardware: Camera and speaker setups for input and output.

Contributions
Contributions are welcome to improve the chess engine, enhance move algorithms, or refine the computer vision integration. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
